I use Google scholar to find new papers all the time, but search results sorted by year are often littered with conference abstracts.
This chrome extension allows you to provide a list of journals you would like to remove from your google scholar searches.

TODO
- Automatically apply block list to papers revealed after "SHOW MORE" is clicked.
- Allow user to emphasize certain journals as well as remove them.
- Update popup logo.
